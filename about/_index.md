Data Science and Business Analytics are my passions. My name is Volak sin and I have been involving in the data science field for about 3 years. I started my professional career wanting to be an Actuary. 
After spending time in an actuarial analyst role and passing actuarial exams, I came across a predictive modeling and data science related project. I was apart of an explorartory team that was responsible for developing a 
model that could help reduce employee medical expenses for one of our fortune 500 client. After working on that project, I was hooked and have solely focus on Data Science and Machine learning.
